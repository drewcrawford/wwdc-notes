Discover how SwiftUI can help you quickly iterate and explore design ideas. Learn from Apple designers as they share how working with SwiftUI influenced the design of the Maps app in watchOS 10 and other elements of their work, and find out how you can incorporate these workflows in your own process.

Real exapmels from our work on newly-redesigned maps app in watchOS 10.

Huge fans of swiftui.  Validate design concepts, unique capabilities, better understanding of how interfaces are constructed and brought to life.  

Common things should be easy, complex things should be possible.  Don't spend time recreating common UI elements.  At the same time, you won't feel limited when it's time to create something brand new.

Microwave - everyone can use one, great for simple things.  But it may not be the right tool.

Raise the ceiling -> industrial espresso machine.  Enable you to make incredible drinks, they can be uanpproachable, hard to learn, difficult to learn something simple.

SwiftUI strikes the balance between these two types of tools.

# SwiftUI as a design tool

Equally helpful is the declarative way things are written.  Builds on our intuition for how things are written.  Declare what you want to create.

You now have access to unique capabilities of apple hardwsare.  Haptics, audio, cameras, gestures, accelerometers, etc.

Design with dynamic maps with mapkit, pull in weather info, render objects in augmented reality, etc.  All of this happens across apple platforms.  SwiftUI works with iphone, ipad, apple watch, etc.

in most cases, you can even share code.  Take advantage of how system elements adapt on their own.

# Getting the details right

Quickly surface design decisions.

ex, loading states, interationalizeation, dark mode, etc.  These are easily hidden in static  design tools.

Added POI, walking duration, etc.  Moment we started making prototypes, these were obvious.

# Designing for interaction

Everything feels native, because you're working in a truly native environment.  

**Design how things feel**.

It only took a few hours to get this prototype working.  Easy to use the watch's real sensors to make the compass accurate and refine small interaction.

different aniamtions for slow/fast speeds.  

Great OOB experience for many interactions.  When you want something custom, it's a highly-capable tool.  

# Testing your ideas

Design is how it works.  Easy to overlook the testing process in realistic scenarios.  For myself, I can get carried away designing for ideal scenarios.  

Important to identify where designs break.

**Design for realistic scenarios**.  ex, think about contrast in maps/watch because the screen has glare.

We were able to import real data from different types of routes.  revisit chart scale for different elevation profiles, because it's flatter in nyc than in sf.

We build one-off design tools.  Demo of design tool that shows over various map environments.  

# Presenting your work

Another way to test ideas is to share with others. Great tool for presenting your work.  many great ways to share designs, but on-device demos are uinquely effective.

Demos let designs explain themselves.  Multiple demos, single app.  Spend more time evaluating, less time explaining. 

Demos can de-risk a project and prevent confusion, both for you and your team.  No slide deck in the world can compare with one spectacular demo.

SwiftUI is a powerfuld esign tool.
* quickly surface design decisions
* design how things feel
* test in realistic scenarios
* demo on device

we think you'll have a more considered, complete, and well-crafted final product.  

**you can ship what you design**.  More than just an artifact.  Same materials and engineering uses, build/submit apps to the app store and share with others.
