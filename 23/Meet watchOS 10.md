Discover some of the most significant changes to Apple Watch since its introduction as we tour the redesigned user interface and the new Smart Stack. Learn how Apple designers approached the design of watchOS 10 as we explore layout, navigation, and visual style, and find out how you can apply them to create a great app for Apple Watch.

2014 - introduced Apple Watch.  Offer a wide range of stylisticpersonalization in case materials, bands, watch faces.
Ultra - extreme conditions

Many constraints.  Required us to create new methods of interacting.  Digital Crown.  To focus apps to be glanceable, actionable, and responsive.

Apple Watch has evolved a lot.  Displays are larger, brighter, seamlessly integrated.

More capable.  Cellular capability, new health sensors, always-on display, apps.

Watchos10 - new interface.  Intelligently surfaces timely, relevant widgets right on your watch face.

Mover vertically through a consistent organization fo apps.  Control center once, wallet twice.

Redesigned every app.  Clear design principles that you can apply to the design of your apps
* apps are focused and highly specialized
* Optimized for glanceability and short interactions
* Controls and navigation are clear and consistent

Larger, rounded displays.  Increased glanceability with a new approach to layout.

Size, placement of controls, labels, content.  To accommodate different types of content, we designed 3 foundational layouts

* dial
* Infographic
* List

Designed to adapt automatically to different watch sizes.

Background content - weather, etc.

Play a supporting role that provides utility.

* color
* Gradient
* Animated content

Consider using color to help people understand place.  

New materials across the system.  Functional layers, establish hierarchy.

New materials maximize the amount of space for content.  Allows status bar to remain legible.  Additionally, elements using semantic system colors automatically adapt contrast when on top of vibrant materials.

New navigation patterns.  Vertical pagination, source list, and refined hierarchical navigation.

Digital Crown - unique input mechanism.  Doesn’t occlude display.

Navigate to apps, navigate within apps.  In list views, rotate to scroll vertically.  For apps with multiple tabs, watchOS 10 introduces vertical pagination.

use the Digital Crown to navigate rings overview.  

Page indicator has aligned the Digital Crown, adapt, remain visible on any background.  

Smoothly animate elements between pages by manipulating scale, position, information density.

Object permanence as they navigate through fullscreen pages of content.  Limit page to single screen height typically.  Each page can serve a clear and distinct purpose.  But there are cases where it’s necessary to extend.

Message as - two pages.  One for pinned conversations, another for conversations with certain people or groups.

Second page is a scroll view, that scrolls vertically whena ctive page.

Contacts -> first page has photo, etc.  Second page is a scrollview and contains less frequently used details.

* use scrolling pages judiciously
* if possible, place only after fixed-height pages
* use vertical pagination instead of horizontal

rotating crown allows users to compare various times of day.
world clock also makes use of splitviews in watchos 10

source lists.  Users navigate between detail views from multiple entities containing same type of inforamation.

users can tap source list to tap between entities.

traditional hierarchical navigation is still suported, but use rarely.  Only when you can't use sourcelist or as distinct pages.

settings and mail are good examples of when deep navigation is appropriate.

new animation for hierarchical content.

to design a great app, 
* make your app focused and specialized
* keep navigation shallow and us standard navigation patterns
* convey info succinctly in few screweens
* use standard layouts, controls, label sizes, semantic materials, etc.
