Discover the fundamentals of spatial design. Learn how to design with depth, scale, windows, and immersion, and apply best practices for creating comfortable, human-centered experiences that transform reality. Find out how you can use these spatial design principles to extend your existing app or bring a new idea to life.

# Familiar
People should be able to find music with recognizable elements.

Interfaces within windows os people can comfortably see and use.

On this platform, windowsl ive in your space and are part of your surroundings.

## Windows
new visual language.  Glass material, contrast with the world.  Aware of surroundings, adpats to lighting conditions.

system ocntrols to move, close, and resize windows.

move windows anywhere around.  Turns to face you when moving.  Easy to read and use.

Window stays in final position.
## Sizing
super flexible, stretching to fit any size.
Size windows for their content.  ex, safari is tall, keynote is wide.

windows can have flexible shapes.  Use tab bars, toolbars to push outside the window.

These controls are layered above the main window.

when the sidebar is oen in safari...

windows aren't bounded by the screen, remain small when possible.  Be flexible and dynamic, to change shape/size based on content.

If you need a larger canvas, you can give yourself one.  Apps can have multiple windows, which are useful in certain cases.  Display content sxs, multiple webpages at once, etc.

Here in keynote, the slides are in one window, whiel the presenter display is in a smalelr window nearby.  Lets people place the presenter where they want, while keeping slides large.

Ideally, keep to a single window.
## Points
Design with points.
The way we specify the size of IX elements.  In a way that adapts to other screens.

As people move windows, they scale larger/smaller.  This keeps interfaces legible and usable.

If you're used to points on other platforms, familiar way to set interface elements.  Design with points to work at any distance.

# Human-centered
A whole new meaning.  People wear the device, use eyes/hands, etc.  

## Field of view
When people wear the device, they see the world.  Easiest to see things in the center, so place the most important content there.  Use landscape layouts.

ex in safari, we spread out tabs in a grid, wide, to match field of view.  Tabs turn inward towards the center.

Extend content further for immersive experience. But keep main content within the field of view.
## Ergonomics
Place objects comfortably.
By default, windows are placed along a natural line of sight.  When placing your own content, place relative to head in direction they're facing. This helps people see and interact with your content, in different positions, laying back, etc.

Place ocntent away from people.  Further than arm's reach.  Interact at a distance.  Avoid placing content behind, high, or low.

Avoid anchoring content to people's view.  Instead, anchor content to people's space.  Freedom to look around naturally.
## Movement
People can get up and walk around.  Create stationary experiences that require minimal movement.

Unless it's a core part of your experience, people should be able to use your app without needing to move.

when they settle, they pres/hold the digital crown to recenter.  Your app doesn't need to do this.  Instead, rely on this system as a way to reposition your app's content.

# Dimensional
## Space
Great apps take advantage of the space.  While canvas is infinite, physical space is limited.

Be careful not to constrain your app by the physical space available.

Here, a window is moved through a chair.  Whent he window is released, the content becomes visible.  With windows, you don't need to worry about how they fit into space, we figure this out.

Dimming is a simple yet powerful way to maximize space.  Even though the movie overlaps the room, dimming helps focus on the content.  Good balance between surroundings and content.

If your app needs more space, create your own larger than life experience.  Here, we created an immersive cinema to create a huge movie theater.
## Depth
On this platform, depth is anew variable.  Powerful tool for hierarchy and focus.

a small movement allows us to see the object from all sides.

Create hierarchy with depth.  In immersive cinema, playback controls are placed small and nearby.  Nearby can remain small but still take visual precedence over large objects far away.

Use light and shadow as cues.
Some objects emit light, like the movie screen.  Shines onto floor/ceiling.  Most other objects should cast a shadow.  Grounds them, makes them look integrated.  Custom objects should cast shadows.

Prefer subtle depth.  Ex, modal pushes back slightly.  

Not everything needs depth.  Keep text flat, etc.
## Scale

small objects feel personal and lightweight.  Large objects feel impressive, like a giant movie.  Increasing scale completely changes feeling of the movie.

some objects are best viewed at 1:1 scale, shopping app.  Explore different scales, try makign things really big or really small and see how scale makes it feel.
# Immersive
transform the world aroudn you.

## Immersion spectrum
app can fluidly transiition between different states of immersion.  Enhance view, bring to new place, etc.

Shared space.  Full space.  Start in the shared space.  

In keynote, app opens in a window.  When time to place the slideshow, we use dimming.  Dimming is a simple way to create contrast between content and people's surruondings.  When it's time to rehearse the presentation, we can bring peopel onto the big stage, theater, etc.  Lifesize experiences require more room, so keynote is now in a full space and other apps are hidden.

but fullspace moments can exist in the user's space as well.  You can design rich immersive experience without taking over someone's entire view.  Heplful to see hands for keyboard, etc.

feel connected to people's physical surroundings.

remember to keep your design flexible.  Not all spaces are the same, they change over time, etc.
## essential tips
When designing immersive experiences, people can look around and pay attention to different things.  People might feel overwhelmed or unsure of what to do.

Guide people's focus.  To parts of the experience that matter the most.  Your focus is added toward a single object in space.  Attention is drawn here, through motion and spatialized audio, materials, etc.

Design smooth, predictable transitions to create continuity.

Blend thoughtfully with reality.

You can use the shape of a room to anchor content or create physical interactions.  Blend your content.  When blending entire scenes, make sure to use soft edges to smoothly integrate your app.  Avoids abrupt transitions, keeps people focused.

make things feel alive.
Subtle animation can bring liveliness to a scene, like water on a lake, or clouds floating through the sky.  Subtle motion can transform static experiences into something alive and dynamic.

Create atmosphere with sound.
With spatial audio, you can anchor sound to objects in space.  Or create soundscapes taht fully surround you.  To learn more, check out the session 'explore immersive sound deisgn'. [[Explore immersive sound design]]

do more with less
subtle reflections in cinema.  You don't need a whole theater.
## comfort
Make sure to avoid large jumps.  Fade out content in motion.  Fade back in once it's settled.  If people physically move int heir space, immersive epxeriences will also fade out.  Shows peopel their surroundings while in motion.

Make sure to provide a clear way in/out of the immersive experience.  Guide people with short, helpful labels.


# Authentic
Take advantage of unique capabilities.  On this platform, best apps are rich, immersive experiences that make use of people's space.

Before we wrap up, let's apply what we covered.  Starting with a new idea or extending an existing one.  With so many possibilities, start by focusing on one unique aspect that can be spatial or immersive.

Find a key moment

we thought finding photos should be easy.  A window interface, familiar navigation, etc.  When you find the specials hot, the photos grow big.  Lifelike scale is magical.    Panorama.  Key moment.  Only possible with infinite space.

Think about a key moment in your own app.  Focus on one special feature, use content you already have.  Can you enhance a moment with depth and scale?  Transform soemone's space?  Evoke a feeling?  Create memorable experiences.
