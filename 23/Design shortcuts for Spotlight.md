When someone launches  spotlight, your app shortcut can be suggested too.  

Up to 5 app shortcuts.  Doesn't stop at search.  

# Ideation

Focus on essential, habitual actions.

Don't feel compelled to fill up all the spaces.  Fine to have 1/2 shortcuts.

Prefer actionable shortcuts.  ex, not just look at the tab bar.  People already know how to use your app's primary navigation.

Make shortcuts that accomplish your app's primary purpose.  Design shortcuts that are predictable.

ex we don't promote trending podcasts.  

Personalize your app shortcuts using decisions people make in your app.  

* focus on essentials
* Prefer actionable shortcuts
* Be predictable, design for muscle memory

# Creation

Provide an icon for your entity

Titles can wrap to a second line, but be concise.  Don't include your app name.

Make titles as short as possible.

Make icons as recognizable as possible.  Make sure they correspond to your app.  ex reminders uses circles in both places.  Whereas photos uses squares.

Think beyond shape.  Visual queues to maximize the familiarity of app shortcuts.

App icon colors.  By default, icons are multicolor/neutral.  Can infuse your color into spotlight/shortcuts.

Think about peeling the grpahics off your icon to create a gradient/solid color.
