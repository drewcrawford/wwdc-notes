Fully support the features I'll talk about today.

existing foundation of shareplay.  Great way to do things together.  Simple UI patterns for representing what everyone's doing.

SharePlay and spatial persona
even more immersive experience.  Picture yourself sitting in your living room, etc.  

shared context.  body language, gestures, emotions, facial expressions.

# Set the scene
media,vs collaboration, connextion, etc.

share up to 1 window and 1 immersive space at a time.

consider some options.
think of a window like a community tool, whiteboard, table, etc.  

immersive space - like a dedicated room.

every window is marked with shared or not shared.  
private music library to a public player window, etc.
# Start SharePlay
include entrypoitns to shareplay within your UI.  In TV, any play button can be used to start a shared activity.  Platform makes it easy to start/stop shared activity from the top of any window.  People can share any window with no additional work from your app,s imilar to macOS.


# Arrange participants
where your app is positioned, etc, all defined by 1 or 3 sitting arrangements that the platform offers.  *spatial persona templates*.

If it's important for everyone to have a good view, choose side-by-side template.  For an activity that resembles a tabletop, choose the surround template, where app is in the middle.  People can converse over your app, while looking at their own perspective.

If your app is doing things in the background, choose the conversational template.  ensure your activity deosn't rely on everyone getting a  good view.

choose the surround tempalte when there's nothing to present in the middle of the group.


# Shared context and UI
Don't need to manage size, position, orientation of your scenes.

your app is running separately, and each instance could dispaly UI differently.

synchronize everyones' view of content, etc.encouerage everyone to be in the same mode, etc.

sound from window vs soundstage.

we can perceive more actions naturally in facetime, especially when it involves large physical motion.  

*Lean on in-person communication*.  to avoid too much UI, etc.

feel most like their real-life ocunterparts where peopel are free to interact with that they see.  consider being very permissive, impose a consistent and predicatble tway to resolve conflicts.

look for opportunities for software to improve on real-world experiences, comfort, accessibility.

ex, different volume preferencces, different abilities to parse language.  subtitles, etc.

collaboration can be more lively, etc.  In real-life we can use different tools at the same time.  So while people might be looking at what feels like the same app window, they're in different editing modes.  The tools each person has active can be personalized.

Allow each person to open a personal window?  Opening multiple windows, can allow individuals to focus on their own edits while still keeping a shared conetxt.

# Enter a full space
There's a ton of content where there's 1 ideal viewing position.  maybe you separate people into different contexts.

to get the full effect of a capture, you acn enter a full space.  Best seen head-on, so we don't allow sxs viewing.  Think of these moments as if each person has temporarily entered their own room.

# Wrap up
* design how your activity begins
* share as much context as possible
* personalize control for comfort
* in-person cues can replace UI
* know when to diverge from shared context
