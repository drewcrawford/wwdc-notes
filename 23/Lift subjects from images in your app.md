Discover how you can easily pull the subject of an image from its background in your apps. Learn how to lift the primary subject or to access the subject at a given point with VisionKit. We'll also share how you can lift subjects using Vision and combine that with lower-level frameworks like Core Image to create fun image effects and more complex compositing pipelines. For more information about the latest updates to VisionKit, check out â€œWhat's new in VisionKit."
