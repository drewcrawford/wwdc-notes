Discover how you can use sound to enhance the experience of your visionOS apps and games. Learn how Apple designers select sounds and build soundscapes to create textural, immersive experiences. We'll share how you can enrich basic interactions in your app with sound when you place audio cues spatially, vary repetitive sounds, and build moments of sonic delight into your app.

example involving find my.  Locate objects naturally.  In this case, I used spatial audio to locate my iPhonei n the room.

In the real world, sound reverberates through space.  While the system can mimic this behavior, because it understands spaces around you.

How does this work on headset?

# Spatial Audio

will sound closer or father away depending on how placed.

System considers size and materials in your room to allow accurate audio playback.  This concept helps define how we hear sound on this platform.






# Interaction sounds
Each time you interact with keys, familiar sound confirms your action.  You may notice each keypress sounds a little different.  It helps to slightly randomize some elements.  Feels more natural and less static when keys are pressed in rapid succession.  Consider this to help your sounds be more natural.

While skeumorphic sounds are interesting, they don't fit the visual aesthetic.  How to fit in with rest of system sounds?  A good UI sound should be subtle and give just enough feedback to be helpful.  Strive to make it fit with overall feel of UI.

minimal sounds, etc.  Match timing of transitions.  When you begin to add interaction sounds, keep in mind people hear them often, so keeping them subtle is important.

# Immersive apps

We have the freedom to curate the best UX.  Stay as close to reality but we can make things more pleasant than actually exist.  ex, water drainage near pretty photo.

For the ambient background  audio, we used a series of different microphones that record immersive audio.  Capture how air sounds all around you in a place.  We would record all through the day and night to make sure we captured the full range of sound activity.

Set out in search of places with little noise polluion.  Usually required going off the beaten path.  Base layers that play under the spatial audio sources.

High-sensitivity spatial mics to zoom in on specific sounds.  Pros can record sounds for you, but HQ sound libraries also exist.

Once we've recorded sounds, how to create a realistic soundscape?  We use that same thinking for placing audio objects in environments.  Draw from RL experiences.  

Use randomization to place frogs randomly.  Alterante between a collection of different frog recordings as well.  And timing.

# Best practices
* randomization
* Placement
* Volume

Even if your app takes place in physical room, can use an immersive soundscape.
