Lightweight and native.
Available instantly

Don't live on the device
...unless you get the app

App clip icons get automatic treatment from OS

Small businesses usually show up as a small part of a different brand.
Think like a POS, etc.  
App clips -> custom experience for the small business.
# Discovering app clips
Unlike with apps, you don't find app clips by going to the app store and searching by name etc.  Instead, you find app clips in context.

App clips from physical tags.
* app clip codes -> consistent appearance, recognizeable
	* contain NFC tag
	* and visual tag
	* more info soon

You want a different tag for each location so we can show the right menu.
Can also use different tags within a location.  Each table could have a different tag so it knows which order to go to.

You can also attach app clips to locations.  Show up in maps.

## from built-in apps
Some clips don't have a location.  App clips work for experiences that are totally virtual.

Smart app banner
* Give people a better experience
* Enable new kinds of experiences.  e.g., platform APIs.
* Start in the right part of the app clip

## app clip card
Your chance to show what your app clip can do.

* Title -> what tells people what your app clip is.  For most clips, this is the name of the app or the name of the brand.
	* But if your app focuses on a specific feature, you can use that feature as part of the title.
* Subtitle -> explain what it is that your app clip does.  They might not know what your name means.  
* Header image.  Show visually what it is that you can get out of your app clip.  Stick to either a photograph or custom graphic.  Don't use screenshots or custom text.  
* Button -> action.  
	* open -> default, general
	* view -> showing information or visualizing
	* play -> media / games
* app metadata is also displayed in the card.

# Designing for app clips

*Great app clips are simple*
*Great app clips are fast*

1.  Purpose.  Decide what your app clip is for.
2.  Minimum flow.  Find what's essential to complete that task
3.  Offer the full app.  Describe the added features a full app offers.

Avoid any type of settings or management.

## designing UI
* notifications are a great way to provide information that's essential.  By default, 8 hours after use.  We think this is enough time to do most tasks.
	* You can request explicit authorization for additional week
	* Keep notifications on task.  
* Promote app after ask is complete.

# wrap-up
* Lightweight experiences available instantly
* Use app clip codes in the real world for discovery
* Focus on a specific task
* More people can use your app than ever before
