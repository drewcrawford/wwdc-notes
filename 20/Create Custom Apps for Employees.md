# Employee-driven design
Important to allow the employees who do the job to drive the design process.

* Interview and observe
	* new - recently trained, by the book
	* veteran - may have their own workarounds
	* midrange
* Prioritize direct experience rather than managers who are focused on the ideal or improved process.
* Begin with a wholistic understanding.  Standard day in their life.  Entire day.  Does work get done over the morning coffee?  Find blockers that may not be obvious.
* Get the details.  

## interviewing tips
* create a safe space.  No managers to influence the responses.
* Avoid assumptions.
* Constantly ask "why?"
* Think about how store managers might not be able to understand shift scheduling.
* Have empathy for the employees you interview.

* Keep it focused.
