# Achievements
We've redesigned achievements in a collectible card format.
* standard -> earned once requirements are met
* progressive -> e.g. a progress bar to the achievement
* hidden -> details remain a mystery until unlocked

Artwork should be eyecatching, complement look and feel, and make players feel rewarded.  Avoid text inside artwork.  Upload custom images for each achievement.
