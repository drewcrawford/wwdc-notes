"Proactive".
"Siri"
System, Apps, People.

"Intelligence is design"

# Living design
Ultimately the core job of a designer is to help people accomplish something.  By leveraging the familiar.
On iOS, someone can easily recognize the share button.
Intelligence is a platform convention too.
But unlike a glyph, no two people's siri suggestions are alike.

## Intelligence is expected
People get frustrated when their expectations aren't met.

# Extensibility
For many people, they think about apps like the lifecycle, launch, put away, etc.
But for years we've been evolving.  Extensions, SiriKit, shortcuts, app clips.
