# Web navigation
Left => navigator and filter bar.  Allows you to navigate through your documentation.
Right => content view.  Optimized to be flexible for multiple screen and navigator sites.
Since navigator is separate from content, switch betwen pages.  
Understand the documentation hierarchy.

Filter bar => refine resutls in the navigator.

Clear the filter to reset the navigator.  Filter to see articles, tutorials, etc.  Ex, 
# Optimize your content

Tips and tricks.  
* tutorials
* articles 
* protocols
* structure

Already a great start, but.  

1.  Define main high-level themes
2. Organize pages by improtance and specificity
3. Optimize group titles

Helps people understand thed boundaries and characteristics of a region.  Creating a map.

Already a lot of functionlity we can achieve in our 3 groups.  "Essentials" for our introductory concepts.  By reducing the number of options, I'm increasing developers' chances of taking the next step.  No magic number for how many topics to create, but I try to stick to under 10 per page.

Order of my groups is vital to create a great experience.  Let's put essentials on top.

* essentials
	* first things developers will see.
	* highlight introductory articles and tutorials
		* Meet SlothCreator tutorial
		* Getting Started with Sloths article
		* Sloth struct -> core API
* Repeat this for the other groups

Make sure the titles are high-quality.  First characteristic to great title is clear and descriptive.  Makes sense on its own and doesn't need additional context.

"Management".  About what to do to manage your sloths.  At first glance, this seems like a good title.  But it's such a broad term, it could mean a ton of different things.  To make this clearer, I'm going to call it `Care and Feeding`.  

make topic group titles **Mutually exclusive**.  ex., fueling superpowers and getting magical abilities are similar.  Which one contains what I want?  By keeping them mutually exclusive, I'm making it simpelr to figure out where to go next.

The more work I put into organization and page titles, the more likely developers will have a smooth path to the page I'm looking for.

By organizing well-thought-out themes next to each other, I'm enabling developers to find relevant topics.  

# Wrap up
* Identify main themes
* Organize by importance and specificity
* Encourage serendipity
* Write clear, mutually exclusive titles
