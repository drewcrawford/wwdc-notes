Our goal is to help you grow your business by providing you with the unique insights about your app.

App benchmarking.  Help you get better insights tahn ever before.  We will begin with 
# Overview
We share data with you about your app's acquisition, usage, and monetization.  Overview page shows how app is performing over time across key perf metrics.  Monitor results in each stage of the customer lifecycle, from awareness to conversion and retention.

Since you're focused on growth, let's say one of your top business priorities is to improve conversion rate.  You've been making improvement.  It's unclear how much more improvement to achieve wtih continued effort.  Do you have more opportunity to grow?  Should you focus somewhere else?

That's where benchmarking comes in.  Learn about the performance fo your app similar to your app, in a privacy-friendly way.

* travel app category
* subscription business model

> Without revealing the performance of any particular app in your peer group


We include enough apps to provide meaningful results in the aggregate.  We show you the distribution of your peer group looks like, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile.  See how you are performing relative to peers.  
# Metrics
Let's talk about the metrics that you will be able to use.

1.  Acquisition
	1. Conversion rate (app install)
2. Usage
	1. Retention (1,7,28)
	2. Crash rate
3. Monetization
	1. Average proceeds per paying user


# Relevancy and privacy
Throughout development, we strived to create peer groups that are highly relevant, while also protecting privacy of each app in the group.

We use a number of attributes on the app store to create your pper groups, including the app store category.  

We will look at how you monetize.  Free, freemium, paid, paidmium, subscription.  

Differential privacy.  When we calculate the conversion rate, we add small amounts of noise to each datapoint we share.  Ensure taht enough apps aer in your pper grup that it is not possible to know if a particular app is in or out of your group.Noise obscures exact makeup.

# Taking action
what to do based on the information.

acquisition: product page optimization, custom product pages, etc.
These features can help you boost your conversion rate.

Usage: in-app events, app clips.
