Apple design team working on AR.
**AR blends virtual objects with the real world.**

**AR is immersive.**

AR feels like magic.

# Introduction

# What can you use AR for?
* deliver a true representation
	* instant, visceral sense of scale.
* Involve physical space
	* Use swatches or stock photography?
	* vs show them the painted walls
* Visualize in 3D
	* Build features that help people try on things in a way that's virtual yet realistic enough to create a confident purchasing decision
	* Quality of lighting and shadows can have a huge impact on people feeling that things are really there.

[[Create parametric 3D room scans with RoomPlan]]

* Streamline actions
	* Use AR to build compact, yet incredibly useful features that save people time.  e.g., measure displays a person's height.

Lots of way to incorporate AR.  
# Tips for working in AR
## AR is spatial
## AR is movement-based
## AR is tied to the physical environment

* seek the right environment
	* safety
	* surfaces with texture
	* lighting
* take advantage of screen space
	* illustrates how to handle text in screen space.  Updates as camera moves.
	* If you do need to lock your text to the world, try to keep it billboarded.  Text on a background, etc.
* Design for constant movement
	* Provide real-time feedback as people move.  People can still connect with the experience even if it's out of view.
* Think about ergonomics
	* Exhausing to hold arm out for long periods of time.
	* Legibility as it's at arm's length
	* larger buttons and legibility
* Design for a limited field of view
	* Allow people to scale objects in case they can't bakc up enough
	* haptics to scale past 100%
	* Use sounds and haptics to guide people to pan.  
	* Provide a map or bird's eye view?
* Use depth cues
	* scale, perspective, shadows, textures, overlapping.  These create a feeling of depth.
* Limit the duration of the experience
	* A minute or two.  Ergonomic reasons, but also AR is a resource-intensive superpower and has a big impact on battery and thermals.
	* make sure you build in breaks.  for all mankind lets you explore interactive objects.
		* Presented in chapters that provide moments of rests, pause, etc.

# Wrap up
AR feels like magic when it's useful, delightful, and leads to the physical world.  See virtual objects or even to transform your environment.  Attach digital capabilities to phyiscal things.  AR features and apps that you create will transform how people work, learn, etc.  can't wait to see what you build next.
