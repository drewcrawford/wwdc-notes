Design and expansion of thigns used on our platform.
Functional and expressive fonts.  

# Meet the family
SF Pro
* pro rounded
	* used in many platforms
* compact
* compact rounded
	* compact variations optimized for narrow columns and small point sizes
	* defaults on watchOS
* mono
	* xcode, swift playgrounds

comprehensive weights from ultralight to black.  
mostly optimical sizes.  Font to automatically adjust based on point size.  ex. moving dot in `i` away from its base shape.

All these aadjustments optimize the fonts to fit different point sizes.  For both display and text setting.

We identified a set of specific tasks that couldn't be filled by weight and optical axis.  Photos, news.  
# Explore the new widths
* Regular
* condensed
* Compressed (even more compact)
* expanded

Depending on design intent, some perform better than others.  No absolute rules

HOw to make more informed decisions during the process of choosing fonts.
* same language support
* typeset most languages taht use the latin script
* but also cryllic languages
* same vertical proportions
	* mixing fonts is predictable
	* only horizontal proportions change
	* stem thickness remains very consistent
	* negative area becomes tighter/wider.  

regular
* features standard proportions, making text easy to read
* when functionalities otherwise are not necessary

condensed
* comfortable width, fits more text

compressed
* very dense proportions.  Much tighter, very space-efficient
* graphical and ideal as a display size

expanded
* striking loose and open appearance, display text setting
* also smaller labels and secondary content

copmare space efficiency.  

shortening/lengthening a paragraph.  Filling space, etc.

The compressed style might be too tight for longer passages of text.  Always consider legibility when opting for a non-regular width.

New render widths join other styles bringing evne more visual interest in our memories.  Text treatments that celebrate and elevate content.

difference in scale takes care of typographic hierarchy.  Two contrasting width styles e.g.c ompressed vs expanded make text visually impactful.

Can use one width, and contrasting width.
Or pick a single weight, and use different widths.

Can combine both appraoches by mising opposite width and weight.  

Using condensed allows a long headline to be more space efficient.  Compressed makes it even more efficient.

Notice expanded widths contrast the headline.

See maps, larger graphical areas like mountain ranges.  Maps created a rich typographic system, but also diverse and contrasting, making it easier to read labels, etc.

Often 2-3 styles are more than enough, but SF pro supports even the most elaborate grpahics system.

> with great typographic power, comes great repsonsibility

designed to make interfaces beautiful, but also *legible* and *accessible*

## Recap
* Space efficiency
* Reinforce hierarchies
* expressive display styles
* Latin, greek, and cyrillic
	* if localization is an essential aspect, make sure you have a fallback plan.

# Welcome SF Arabic
Our devices are used by people alll over the world.  Fonts play a huge role in interfaces.  Buttons, platters, icon labels, etc.

Achieve the highest level of consistency with hello text, etc.  Typograph watch face.  

We want to bring the same level of consistency to the system fonts.  Allowing other writing systems to benefit.  Providing a reading experience that is both visually engaging and comfortable, every language, every platform.

SF Arabic.  Designed to seamlessly integrate with the rest of the SF families.  Latest writing system after latin, greek, and cyrillic, to benefit from advanced technologies.  Liek the other SF families, it featuers the full gamut of weights, ultralight through black.  Includes optical sizes.  Allowing fonts to automatically adjust to stroke contrast, etc.  

Text styles are fine-tuned for high legibility.  Display sizes have simpler geometry.  Clean and contemporary look.

Automatic and dynamically taken care of by the system, enabling a comfortable experience at all sizes. 

Arabic is also used to write other languages, persion, pashto, etc.  Excited to announce that this year we're introducing a new member: SFArabic Rounded.  Same great featuers of SF Arabic coming with a full range of weights and optical sizes.

expands the stylistic range of arabic, and joins the rest of the system fonts, making platforms modern, clear, and refined.
