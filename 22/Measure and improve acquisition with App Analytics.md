# Key metrics

When you first login to app analytics, taken to an overview page with a number of different metrics.  Impressions, product page views, conversion rate, etc.

Impression -> any time someone sees your app icon on the app store.  Product page. Today,g ames, apps tabs.  Search results.
Product page view -> obvious.  Keep in mind, because your product page also includes your app icon, it's also an impression.

Impressions per day, and view the data over time to see how you're performing.

Two variations.  Unique impressions, unique product page views.
"unique" -> same user, same day, non-unique?

Conversion rate = total downloads / unique impressions.

One of the main areas that you can improve using tools in ASC.  How to improve thorughout the presentation.

Total downloads

First-time downloads and redownloads.  
First time: get/buy
Redownloads: cloud button

If a user's settings are set to automatically download across devices, these are NOT counted.  Redownloads for app analytics only includes direct on app store.

By closely monitoring these metrics, see how many user's you're acquiring and how you get them.

# Acquisition sources

Territory, source type, page type.

## Territory

On overview page, you can scroll down to view a list of which territories are driving the most downloads for your app.  Full list, 'See All'.

ex, is product page localized?

Viewing metrics by territory.  

## Source type
app store browse, search, app referrer, web referrer.

app store browse -> finds app browsing appstore on today, apps, games tab.  Featured, top charts, etc.
search -> duh
app refer -> someone discovers your app inside another app, ex in-app advertisement
web refer -> link on a website in safari and download your app from there.

*browser other than safari -> app refer for that browser, rather than web refer*

## Page type

* Product page
* store sheet (SKStoreProductViewController)
* no page.  ex when people download your app directly from today, games, apps, or search without tapping into product page.

Filter by app refer, to see which people are coming from a different app.  When running an ad campaign, send users to app store product page, or store sheet.  Choice you make could meaningfully impact conversion.  Look at this data to decide which is best for you.

Or filter by app store search.  
# Peer group benchmarks
Help you put your app's performance in context by comparing your data to similar apps.  

groups based on
* app store business model (free, freemium, paid)
* app store category
* app store download volume

You can see that this app's day 1 retention between 50-75th percentiles.  Consider selecting a more specific category of download volume if available,  Might not be due to privacy?

Can also compare against either primary or secondary category, or all apps combined.  
Consider exploring different options.

# Taking action

## Product page optimization

test up to 3 pages against your original.  Once your PPO test begins, view your results in acquisition tab.  Select your individual test.

On this page, view details about how each treatment is performing.  At the start of your test, see indicators that let you know a test is collecting data.

We recommend waiting until you see at least 90% confidence until you make any changes.
## Custom product pages

drive specific audiences to each page based on a unique URL.  Drive a higher conversion rate than what you'd get from same product page.

View additional metrics including average retention and sessions.
Go to metrics tab and view performance of all product page views together.  Choose different metrics to see how each page is performing.


## In-app events

drive more engagement.  use events to promote in-app experiences.  Game competition, new movie premiere, etc.  New and existing users into your app.

event metrics.  Impressions, opens, reminders, pageviews.
