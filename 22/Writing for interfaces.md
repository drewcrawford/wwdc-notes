UX writers, content designers.  Strings, copy, text.  Design through the lens of language.

First macs were built on the design principle WYSIWYG.  Simple language that was easy to understand.  Focused on the person using it.  We say "Hello."  Since those early days, we've continued to be conversational in our interface.

Words are pivotal to UX.  

Writing includes the words.  But it also includes the structure of tohse words, the timing in which they appear, and the feeling people have reading them.  

The earlier you make writing part of the process, the better experience will be for peopel who use it.  PACE.

Creating a natural flow so you keep people engaged and interested in what you're telling them.  

# Purpose
What's the most important thing someone needs to know at that moment?  It's the purpose of your screen.  First, consider information hierarchy.

## consider information hierarchy

> You know the purpose because it's right at the top

Proceeds to show the *second* item on the screen...

Next, you might have read the button that says "choose name and photo".  We know people don't read thinsg in order, make sure headers and buttons are clear.  The rest of the text still has an important puropse, it tells you what you can customize, etc. but it's samller.

Information hierarchy conveys screen's purpose.

## Know what to leave out
When you knwo the purpose of a screen, make choices about what to keep, remove, move somewhere else.

Think about the purpose of this screen.  Is it to tell you why?  To tell you can still make an emergency call?

## Have a purpose for every screen

Aim for simplicity.  You can tell people the purpose of a screen.  

When there are multiple steps in a flow, define the purpose for the whole flow, and every screen in it.  Think about how to welcome people in and teach them waht they need to know.  Here are screens designed to set up apple cash for famling sharing.  Text tells you who apple cash is for.  

Purpose is to let you know what to do next.  Verify identity.  Important information about data and privacy.  This takes up quitea  bit of space, but it's important, core value, etc.

After you verify your identity, you're still not quite ready to start using the feature.  "Almost Ready" screen tells you to expect a notification, etc.

* Know what to leave out
* Have a purpose for every screen
# Anticipation
## Think of a conversation
In every good ocnversation there's a back and forth.  Listening, talking, asking questions.  In your app, you're anticipating how to best communicate for each moment.  Let's say you're sleeping in, so you go to clock app.

Sleep screen has a friendly and familiar tone.

If you get up before the alarm, it anticipates that you might not want that alarm to sound.  Conversation feels intuitive, like your device is speaking to your needs.

## Develop your voice and vary your tone
What would it say and not say?  Are you developing a game that's exciting and fun?  Is it a bankign app that needs to be secure and trustworthy?  Is it kid-friendly?

Make a list of commonly used terms.  This can help shape the voice that you can also use for your website, emails, ando ther communication.

Anticipating what people are going through helps.

We have one voice, but different tones.  

## Know what comes next
In the Breathe app on apple watch, it says "be still, and bring your attnetion to your breath."  Then it says "Now inhale..." and "exhale".  It answers your question of how to use it as the visuals reinforce the message.

In this ex from maps, when you're likely to be heading home, it tells you about your commute.  It helps you make a decision by anticipating what you'll do next.  

## Anticipation
* think of a conversation
* Develop your voice adn vary your tone
* Know what comes next
# Context
## Think outside the app
Are they at home, or traveling?  Are the preoccupied?

We show the summary screen at the end of a workout.

In panorama, words appear right below the arrow because that's where you're looking.

## Write helpful alerts
Chances are your app has some alerts which are best used when someone confirms an action or make a choice.  They are interruptions, so you want them to be helpful and clear.

Some alerts might have a destructive action, osmething that can't be undone.  
> Remove iPhone?

Buttons are "Remove" and "Cancel".  Someone needs to make an important choice.  Remove is red.  Be careful how you use cancel. ex, "Confirm cancellation".  

Buttons are **not** labeled yes and no.  Always be specific about the actions the button will take.  Here if you only read the button labels you would still understand what yuo're choosing.

Errors often show up as alerts.  Interjectiosn like "Ooops!" or "uh-oh" can sound patronizing.  "Please, sorry" sound insincere.

## Create useful empty states
Times for education or celebration, like when you complete the last item on your todo list, but it depends on context.

In this made-up restaurant app, it uses the title 'nothing striek your fancy?' which has a whimsical feeling.  But the idiom might not be universally understood or translate well.  

ex, apple podcasts library shows you, you have "no saved episodes".  Explains if you save episodes they will show up here.

## Context
* think koutside the app
* write helpful alerts
* Create useful empty states


# Empathy
## Write for everyone
In user experience writing, ahving empathy means you should aim to write for everyone.  Speak to your audience, but don't leave anyone out.  Best to use simple, plain language as idioms and humor may be misunderstood, exlude people,e tc.

## Be responsive to localization
Your app needs to adapt to a lot of languages and cultures.  When you translate from one language to aonther, words can get longer or shorter.  Etc.

Word length.

In US english, calendar abbreviations are a single letter.  M for MOnday, T for Tuesdya, and so on.  In catalan, the days of the week are abbreviated to two letters.  Arabic, they aren't abbreviated at all.  Your UI needs to adapt to those language changes.

## Design for accessibility
Your app used by as many peopel as possible.  Someone hwo is blind or has low vision, may set their device to display bold or larger text, or use VO to navigate.  Pay attention to the language you use in your app.  

Every element needs to have thoughtful, useful, descriptive text.  Not just VO for navigation items, but any symbols, graphs, or images as well.

> Person tilting head t to the side with hand besides mouth as if sharing a secret

Not just physical details but also intention.

> Person meditating with relaxed arms and forefingers touching

Both physical details, and the context of meditation are described.

> nervous person biting fingernails

Each of these examples is described as a "person", not "man" or "woman".  Avoid unnecessary references to specific genders.

## Empathy
* write for everyone
* Be resopnsive to localization
	* including text size changes
* Design for accessibility

See the HIG.

**Read your writing out loud.**  Typos, etc.  

Writing for interfaces begins with curiosity about who is on the other side of the screen.  We know you'll find the right words.
