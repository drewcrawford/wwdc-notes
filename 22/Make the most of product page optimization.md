# Success stories

## Testing themes
* brand/design
* Seasonality
* Screenshot order
* Orientation
* Text callout
* Asset type

## brand/design
Peak - Brain Training
goal: determine which app icon results in highest conversion rate
hypothesis: robot character will convert better
duration: 44 days
avg impressions/treatment: 154K

Testing identified the best performing icon
Results were different from the hypothesis
Applied better performing treatment
Continue to iterate as part of their ongoing optimization efforts


## Seasonality
Angry birds 2, Rovio.
Goal: determine if seasonal screenshots results in highest conversion rate
hypothesis: seasonal screenshot will convert better
duration: 20 days
avg impressions /treatment: 2M

evergreen art performed 1.5% better.  

takeaways
* testing identified evergreen creative converted better
* Results were different from hypothesis
* Control performed better
* iterate and continue testing in close collaboration with development team
## Asset type

simply piano - simply.

goal: determine if an app preview results in highest conversion rate
hypothesis: including an app preview will convert better
duration: 12 days
avg impressions/treatment: 430K

screenshot (no app preview) performed 3.3% higher conversion rate.
In many cases, having an app preview can improve conversion.  But in this case, the video they tested did not perform better.

When it comes to app previews, keep in mind you can test up to 3 video in the same test.  

Takeaways are
* testing identified treatment with no app preview converted higher
* results were different from hypothesis
* continue to iterate and test again
# Key takeaways
* follow an iterative approach
* Limit number of variables
* Test for at least a week, ex weekends vs weekdays, etc.
* Aim for assets that have bold and significant differences.
* Monitor results as the test progresses

## Submission
* plan submission with app releases in mind
* Have assets ready to go to test between app releases
* Include app icon assets with the version of the binary being tested
* follow app review guidelines for asset submissions

## other considerations
* keep testing on app store independent of other platforms.  Other results may not align!
* Look out for external factors, such as seasonality, traffic mix, etc.

keep testing!
