Find out how to create compelling spatial computing apps by embracing immersion, designing for eyes and hands, and taking advantage of depth, scale, and space. We'll share several examples of great visionOS apps and explore how their designers approached creating new experiences for the platform.

# Intentional

Find your key moment.  ex mindfulness app.

Make new things possible.  

Prototype your ideas.  

Build complementary experiences

Consider native frameworks like ARKit/RealityKit.
# Immersive

Transport people somewhere new.  ex immersive space.  Great environments replicate an accurate sense of depth and scale.

Integrate with physical surroundings.  

Design meaningful sound.  Sensors on the device understand characteristics of physical space.  Think of audio as not just ambient music but an opportunity to guide and reward people.  Blackbox.  

# Comfortable

Require minimal physical movement.  Can't predict physical spaces of where your app may be used.  ex consider drawing something to show where movement should take place.

Keep app interfaces cohesive.  Build for the infinite canvas.  Contain within a window.  Tab bar, toolbar,s etc., clear delineation of what your app offers.  Spatial doesn't mean buttons and UI should be arbitrarily floating in people's fov.  PGA tour.  Livestream and tournament information.  

Blend virtual content with the world.  Intelligently adapt lighting, etc.  Kelly FitzGerald, a senior product designer at redbull.   Distracting to use solid color on windows.

Provide hover effects for feedback.

Use at least 60pts of space for tap targets.  

# Delightful

djay - algorythm.

Honor people's spatial awareness.  Keep interactive content close to people.

Create real-world parity.  ex gesture that mimics previewing another song for a dj.  

Abstract away complexities.
