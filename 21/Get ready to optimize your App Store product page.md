# Product page optimization
Different variants of your default page.

We've made sure all users will have a consistent experience.  e.g. app icon.

For anyone who sees your test icon on the product page, they'll see the same icon on the device.  So include the variant icons in your app bundle.

Run tests for specific localizations.  Gives you the flexibility to focus your tests if your treatment is only for a subset of a localization.
