#CloudKit 

* Sharing sample app
* Create a share
* Sharing invitations
* Fetch and modify shared records
* Customize your sharing experience
* Zone sharing

# Sharing sample app
https://github.com/apple/cloudkit-sample-sharing

Each container has 1 public database where all users can potentially read/write.  If a device has a logged-in iCloud account, you have a private database containing that user's data.

* Simple app storing and sharing contacts
* Available on GitHub
* Updated to support Swift concurrency

1.  Create new contact record
2.  Save to private database

# Create a share
Managed by `CKShare` records
Persisted in owner's private database
Describes everything about the share
* Records being shared
* Invitees and participants on the share

Access level for any user with share's link
Default access is none
Modify to provide public access to shared records
Participants represneted by CKShare.Participant objects
Each invited participant can have different permission level
Contained in the `participants` array on CKShare
* Determine the share's root record
	* root record and all children will be shared
* create instance of CKShare
* Save to the *private* database

Saving only the CKShare will generate an error, even if the root record already exists.  

# Sharing invitations
`UICloudSharingController` provided by UIKit
* Send sharing intivations with messages, mail, other apps, or sharing URL
* etc

```swift
// UICloudSharingControllerDelegate

public protocol UICloudSharingControllerDelegate {

    // ...

    // Called after the CloudKit sharing controller failed to save the share record.
    func cloudSharingController(UICloudSharingController, failedToSaveShareWithError: Error)

    // Called after the CloudKit sharing controller saves the share record.
    func cloudSharingControllerDidSaveShare(UICloudSharingController)

    // Called after the user decided to stop sharing the record.
    func cloudSharingControllerDidStopSharing(UICloudSharingController)

}
```

* Process user's acceptance of share
* Enable `CKSharingSupported` boolean in Info.plist

Share metadata provided through `userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith` delegate function
```swift
// Processing a userâ€™s acceptance of a share invitation

func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith shareMetadata: CKShare.Metadata
) {
    let container = CKContainer(identifier: shareMetadata.containerIdentifier)

    Task {
        do {
            try await container.accept(shareMetadata)
        } catch {
            // Handle errors that may occur
        }
    }
}
```

# Fetch and modify shared records
* Records shared with current user available in `sharedCloudDatabase`
* fetch and modify records similar to private and public databases


```swift
// Fetching records shared with the current iCloud user

func fetchSharedContacts(in zone: CKRecordZone) async throws {
    var changeToken: CKServerChangeToken? = nil
    var moreChangesComing = true
    
    while moreChangesComing {
        let changes = try await sharedCloudDatabase.recordZoneChanges(
            inZoneWith: zone.zoneID, 
            since: changeToken
        )

        // Process changes as needed (modifications and deletions)
        processChanges(changes)
          
        moreChangesComing = changes.moreComing
        changeToken = changes.changeToken
    }
}
```

Operation returns `moreComing` representing if there are more changes to fetch.
Change token - pointer to specific change.
Only fetch changes that occur after that point in time.  For the first fetch, set to nil.

* Owners can stop by deleting share
* Owners can also delete shared root record.

Remove participants from CKShare object for individual participants
Users can stop sharing or remove partipants from `UICloudSharingController`
Participants can delete root record to stop share.  Note that thsi only stops participation.  Original root record on owner's side still exists.
or `UICloudSharingController`

# Customize your sharing experience
```swift
// Search by phone number

let phoneNumber = "417-555-9311"
let participant = try await container.shareParticipant(forPhoneNumber: phoneNumber)
```

email, etc.

```swift
// Add participant to existing CKShare record

func addParticipant(_ participant: CKShare.Participant, to share: CKShare) async throws {
    participant.permission = .readWrite
    share.addParticipant(participant)
    try await privateCloudDatabase.save(share)
}
```

Always save the modified CKShare back to private database.

```swift
// Fetch CKShare.Metadata and confirm accepting share from a given URL

func confirmShareParticipation(from url: URL) async throws {
    let shareMetadata = try await container.shareMetadata(for: url)
    try await container.accept(shareMetadata)
}
```

# Zone sharing
* Initialize share with custom record zone instead of root record
* All records in the zone are shared with participants
* Record zones cannot contain more than one type of share simultaneously
* Choose type of share based on use case

[[What's new in CloudKit]]

```swift
// Create a CKShare sharing an entire record zone

func createAndSaveShare(for zone: CKRecordZone) async throws -> CKShare {
    let share = CKShare(recordZoneID: zone.zoneID)
    try await privateCloudDatabase.save(share)

    if share.recordID.recordName == CKRecordNameZoneWideShare {
        // This is managing a shared record zone
    }

    return share
}
```

# Wrap up
* Support sharing in your app
* Create CKShare records and invite paritipants
* Use `UICloudSharingController` or implement your own
* Fetch and modify records shared between users
* Explore use cases for zone sharing
