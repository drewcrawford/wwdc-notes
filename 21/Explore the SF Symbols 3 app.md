#sfsymbols 
How the app can help you create your own apps.

# Find and preview symbols
Add to a custom collection.
Easy to get to, short list of symbols.

Library is constantly growing.  Important that I can use these symbols in all platforms I want to run on

> except windows/android, duh

Use the inspector to see if it's available.

* Deprecated names can be used to support older platforms
* Move to the newest name as soon as possible

## Localization
* Some symbols change based on the user's language
* Prefer no localization suffix, let the system do the work

## Rendering previews
* Color, etc.
* Rendering mode
* Dark mode

[[What's new in SF Symbols]]

# Manage custom symbols
3k symbols bulitin.  But what if we need something custom?

I want to make sure QoH has a special symbol in my app.  

File=>Duplicate as custom symbol.  Start making design changes.

I can export template svg, open with vector editor, and make my modifications ot the design.

Drag/drop back onto custom symbol.

Symbol will update.

Editing for multicolor, hierarchical, etc.

* SF symbols app now helps manage your custom symbols
* Custom symbols can optin to new rendering modes
* New features added to custom symbol templates this year

[[Create custom symbols]]




# Use symbols in projects

* System-provided symbol
* alongside text
* monochrome rendering

Best way to get into design app is SF Fonts.

Alignment and weight is kept in sync with surrounding text for free
SF fonts are installed with the SF symbols app

What about special symbols?  Colors?
Excited to announce that the app now supports copying images of symbols to place in your design comps.

Select as ymbol, set up rendering.  Edit=>copy image.  Paste into your design.

* PNG or SVG
* Copy settings are preserved

## Copy image

May have extra vertical padding.  Done so vertical center of symbols will align.

Unlike using SF fonts, these images aren't guaranteed to be weight-matched.

Excited about the flexibility of these symbols

* Design comps
* Custom symbols
* Multicolor, hierarchical, palette symbols

## code
Make sure to copy name of symbol, rather than the symbol.

Use export symbol... for transferring custom symbols into xcode, rather than exporting the iamge
