iOS + tvOS.  Recently, new tricks for macs as well.

Ability to restore and revive a mac, beginning with apple T2.  Last year, we brought those features to each mac with apple silicon.

1.  Restore 
	1.  (apple silicon) to install latest macOS version
	2.  T2 => Restores the firmware, after which macOS can be reinstalled with internet recovery
2.  Revive => recover a mac while preserving user data.
	1.  Updates firmware while preserving user data
	2.  Choose from advanced actions menu

Use the correct port on your mba with apple silicon, evidently there's one port.  Some particular blessed port differers per model

Use corret port, refer to user guide

For more information, refer to configurator user guide.

# Automated Device Enrollment
Having a device assigned to your ABM or ASM lets you boot to setup assistant.  Need to buy direct from authorized retailer.

If the mac wasn't purchased thorugh one of apple's supported channels, not assigned to your org, can't take advantage of these features.

Configurator hasn't provided a way to do macs outside official channels until now.

# Apple configurator for iPhone.
1.  Sign in with managed apple ID
2.  Scan using iPhone camera
3.  assign to organization

apple id needs "device enrollment manager" role

Look a lot like watch pairing.

Once mac is assigned to organization, can configure ADE settings.

Now it's ready for use by employee or student.  

**Note that a mac assigned using this feature, will be released from your organization if the user unerolls during a 30-day probational period, just like iOS.**
