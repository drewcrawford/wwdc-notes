# Introduction
In the dark ages, keyboards
Then mice
Human-scale interactions with devices nearby.  Remove layers of abstraction and allow users to interact more directly with their surroundings.

Bring these experiences to your own products.


# Design principles
## Consider distance and ability
Share sheet knows who you're pointing at.

Be mindful that these capabilities are not always available.  Accommodate varying levels of capability.

Can help build entirely new experiences.

AirTags.  Previously, I'd only been in the general vicinity, but now I can augment to find.

Scales based on distance.  When further away, hard to remain facing a specific direction.  Wide vs narrow band.  

Design can transform based on distance.  Far away vs millimeters.  Be forgiving with angles at a distance and change feedback by scale.

## Provide continuous feedback
Feedback applied/coreographed at the right time, helps make it discoverable, provides instruction, communicates success/failure.

Feedback you can see, hear, and feel.

Multiple types of feedback worth considering and using together.  

* Visual
* Audio
* haptic

How types of feedback help make the transfer to homepod mini?

Two boundaries across homepod.  When you reach the first zone, when you reach the second zone.  

Continuously provided from the moment you reach the first distance threshold.
* Banner position
* scale
* background blur
* haptic strength
* homepod light
* audio

Look for opportunities to animate.  

Haptic feedback helps.  As does homepod light.

Continuous feeback makes it clear you can cancel/interrupt the gesture.

Critical when designing spatial interaction.

Unique constraints when providing feedback for airtag.

Where not a possiblity, rely more heavily on a single device.  Since AirTag helps you find an item, it's hidden from view.

Responding to movements that are big vs subtle.  Interface gently rotates/responds.  Building blocks of adapting experience.

Feel/hear the arrow snap into place.  Design is tightly coupled to space.

* Be mindful of how people move
* Connect movement and feedback

Pace of pulse picks up and haptics become crisper.  

If I walk away, arrrow disassembles.  Provides important and helpful guidance.


Build in adaptivity and resilience.  

Haptic response changes in character as I move closer and further away.  Sense through my hand where it's hiding.  No sound, haptic is more effective.

Design should be mindful of how haptics work together across senses.

* Consider feedback strengths
* Use senses in concert
* Seek to provide a clear story
* Use feedback judiciously

Your design will complement the phyiscal action.

## Embrace the phyiscal action

Previously would have to go into airplay list, where items are presented equally, whether near me or not.

By embrancing the phyiscal action, an intangible experience is tangible, visceral, and instinctive.

* Consider direct movement for selection
* Emphasize feedback on the target device

Color changes can be read in my periphery.  Feel without having to look at the screen.  More natural pose as I use it.



* Design for multiple senses
* Defer to the primary task
* Reinforce good states
