Can run on a subset of localizations.

Long explanation of how statistical power is calculated in the tool

Your metadata must be reviewed.  If you have a submission already, must wait for it to complete.

For icons, have to add multiple icons to the binary.  If so, an "app icon" tab will appear in ASC.

# Testing strategies
Iterative process.
1.  Design.  Which asset matters most?
2.  Test.  Ensure variations are significant.
3.  Analyze


## Asset testing
Feature: New features/levesl
value proposition

Theme: seasonality, character/content
Creative: asset type, color variations

## Considerations
* Traffic proportion
	* Note that no treatment can receive more traffic than original
* Assets and treatments
* Localizations
* Duration


## Indicators
Original product page => baseline
Collecting data => unable to determine with p=0.9
Performing better, p=0.9
Performing worse, p=0.9
Likely to be inconclusive => within the 90 day limit

## Keep a lookout for
* Not reaching statistical significance
* Testing variations not signficiant enough
* Incorrect test setup
