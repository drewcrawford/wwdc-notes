# Why we make apps and games?

At the end of the day, they add emotional and practical value to our lives.  Enable as many people as posssible to enjoy these benefits.

175 regions, 40 languages.  You owe it to yourself to design with inclusivity in mind, so that your app/game is great for everyone.

**Inclusive design is great for everyone.**

Great usability isn't the only important goal

**Inclusive design is welcoming and respectful**

Cultures we're familiar with, and languages we speak or hear around us.  Also shaped by our human characteristics.  Gender, age. Physical/mental abilities or disabilities.

Each of these factors as its own diversity access.  The intersection of where someone lands makes up their unique identity.

**People should feel like you designed with them in mind.**

# Designing inclusively
## Content
* Writing
* imagery
* audio
* video

Language you use to speak to your audience.

Great moments where you can help people feel welcome.

 # Tell diverse stories
 People who might use your app or game come from a rich set of backgrounds/experiences.  Make them feel included.
 
 Webpage, app store.  
 * Names
 * Content
 * Example scenarios.  e.g. example feed, todo list, etc.

Tell interesting and diverse stories.  We've made content more relatable and inclusive to more people.  Names, etc.

When putting screenshots together, tempting to put screenshots you're familiar with.

Will help stand out even more.

 # Avoid stereotypes
 **Stereotypes are oversimplified beliefs**
 
 All of us hold these types of beliefs, usually we aren't aware we have them.  But if you're not careful, you may be unconsciously excluding people by not recognizing them in funcitonality.
 
 e.g. Men and women.  There's a spectrum of human gender, and you can honor diversity by avoiding unnecessary references to a gender binary.
 
 e.g. use `They`.  Avoid overlooking parts of your audience by referring to people as a single gender ("hey guys")
 
 Also applies to visuals.  e.g. does your placeholder icon have masculine avatar?  This tells a story about who you think your app is for and maintains the message that a generic person is a masculine person.
 
 Don't exclude people by unintentionally using ablist language.
 
 **Ableism is a stereotype that certain abilities are normal**
 
 Ableist language can be deeply embedded in the way that we talk and can slip into copy.  insane, crazy, etc.  Even positive references can label a condition as an outlier.
 
 Avoid referring to disability in language when suggesting that something is "less than".  But recognize/reinforce disability to reflect the diversity of people using your app.
 
 single parents, multigenerational households, adult children, etc.
 
 Develop your awareness of your own stereotypes.  Look for diversity in lived experiences that can help you recognize where you rknowledge falls hosrt.
 
 > Language is constantly evolving
 
 # Adopt accessibility
 Imagine someone who is blind has just downloaded your app.  
 
 Millions of people use at least 1 accessiblity setting.  You might find accessibility helpful at some point in your life.
 
 * Having your pupils dilated at the optometrist
 * Exposure to loud sounds after a concussion
 * ?

## Dynamic type
Make sure your app functions properly across the range of DT settings.  By using the right layout APIs, your apps layout should adapt flexibly and automatically.

Take care that your app is intelligible across the size gamut.  Rethink some layouts if they have trouble with larger sizes.

Consistently honors e.g. font weight.  e.g. if they have bold text turned on, make sure that elements that aren't text, which might need to be legible, are thickened.  e.g. circles, etc.


## VO
Absolutely critical.  But VO benefits people who have other reasons not to look at the screen.  Riding a bus, motion stick, etc.


If you use a glyph from SF Symbols, VO will use the symbol's name.  Might not be enough for functionality.

Add descriptor that makes more sense in your app's context.  

Check order of VO elements.  

## Testing
Try your app or game with accessibility settings turned on.  Put stuff in accessiblity shortcuts menu.

Text size toggle.  Try experiencing in grayscale.  Try with no sound.  

QuickType was a solution to a challenge to one group of people, ended up heping many more.


 # Localize for culture
 A big step in growing your app or game's reach is translating into different languages.
 
 Remember that even in your country, people speak different or multiple languages.
 
 ~50% of the world's population speak more than one language.  
 
 * Formatting
 * Dubbing audio
 * Captions

**Make content relevant to different cultures**

Matters even if you're only focused on one country.  Still come from multipel cultural backgrounds.

Double-check whether you're using phrases that only make sense to certain people

> Nine cows and one hair

Imagine if your app's copy says something like "from A to Z".  How is this translated?

Avoid metaphors and complex terms.  Easier to translate, more culturally inclusive.

Check out new section on writing inclusively in the apple style guide website.

**Respect norms and customs**

In india, a large portion of the population are vegetarian and follow hinduism where it's uncommon to eat them.  Can come off as insensitive to local culures.  Instead, tailor app's content to local dietary customs.  Recognize cultural moments.  Festival food.  

In games, respecting cultures can come into play if you have characters or environments that are inspired by real-life people and places.

**Avoid caricatures**

Am I associating an enemy with someone from a marginalized race?

Am I basing an alient or exotic character out of physical characteristics of real ethnicities?  Take care with how you depict others.  


 # Use color mindfully
 **Colors elicit emotion**
 
 In western countries, green can symbolize environmentalism
 cyan may symbolize luck or fortune
 
 but in asian countires, red may symbolize fortune, happiness and wellbeing.
 
 Red can be associated with love and red roses.  Or danger, negativity, and even violence.  These associations are why stocks shows green/red.  *But if you set your region to mainland china, gains are shown in red.*
 
 As with localizing for culture, best way to fully understand if your choices make sense is ask people who come through those backgrounds.
 
 5% experience colorblindness.  Make sure your interface elemnets don't solely rely on color.
 
 Pay attention to contrast ratio betwen text and backgrounds, particlarly for increased contrast.
 
 High contrast mode => additional system colors automatically
 
 You will need to calculate luminosity between background/text.  
 
 **When increased contrast mode is turned on, aspire to a minimum of 4.5:1.**
 
 Note that in some cases this isn't good enough.  Correctly assessing contrast is an art rather than a science.
 
 
 # Encourage self-expression
 
 ## Names
 
**What's your name?**

Accept the diveristy of names people can have.  Often, names don't pass form validation because they have hyphens, accents, or are shorter or longer than an allowed character count.

Be flexible in special characters and not enforcing specific name lengths.  

First name / last name are region specific.  Latin-americans often have two family names.  In china, family is written first and personal is last.

In some countries like malaysia and afghanistan you might not have a family name.

Ask people their preferred name, which can differ from what they go by legally.  If you address someone by name...

## Gender

 Presenting someone with limited options doesn't represent how broad the spetrum is.  At registration you have the choice to register from a wide range of gender options.  
 
 In games with human character creation screens, how you let people customize themselves helps acknowledge identity.
 
 Consider all the ways people might want to represent themselves with different appearances.
 
 Give people the agency to choose relationships based on different sexual orientations.
 
 *Design flexible interfaces that respect identity*
 
 # wrap up
 * Tell diverse stories
 * Avoid stereotypes
 * Adopt accessibility
 * Localize for culture
 * Use color mindfully
 * Encourage self-expression

**Inclusive design is welcoming and respectful.**

**Inclusive design is great for everyone**

When we craft something with respect, consideration, and love, that can be felt.
