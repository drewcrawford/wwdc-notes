Event badges.
* challenge - activity that encourages a user to achieve a goal within time.  
* competition - activity in which users compete against one another to achieve a ranking or win awards
* live event - activities that occur in realtime that all users experience simultaneously.  e.g. livestreamed concert.  
* major update - significant new features, content, or experiences.  
* new season - new content, storylines, or media libraries.  
* premiere - first-time availability of content or media.
* special event - limited-time events that are not captured by another event badge.  Possibly spanning multiple activities or experiences.  Only select this if none of the others describe your event.

If none of these seem appropriate, *the content should not be considered an event.*

Publishing the event before the start time may be useful to build anticipation for the event.  Up to 31 days, up to 14 days before start date.  Customize dates/times for each location.

Event purpose.  If your event is specifically intended to attract new users, lapsed users, etc., can specify that here.

Continued engagement - repeat conversion.
Re-activation, re-engagement. 

Deeplink for every event.  Custom URL that opens in-app to a particular place.  We recommend using a universal link.  See resources?

This URL is passed directly to your app, so avoid using URL shorteners etc.

Consider taking them through any necessary onboarding.  Provide users a way to return to the main app experience.

Test deeplinks on iOS 15.  Paste links into notes app and tapp to launch.

Priority.  High-priority events will appear ahead of normal priority.  Will not affect search ranking relative to other apps.  Indicate whether IAP is required.  Will appear as a label.

Can have up to 10 approved events per-app at a given time.  5 events published across all storefronts.  Region-specific events will reduce events in other regions.  Please be aware that once an event has been submitted, cannot also submit an event or binary until after approved.

# Putting it all together
Set goal => determine desired impact or KPIs
concept => event strategy such as target audience, timing, feasibility, blockers, solutions
plan => 
execute => 
monitor => user engagement, etc.
analyze => behavior of particular user segments before/after the event.  

Whether or not you've previously employed an event strategy, can supplement current approach etc.
