People are very different.

# Empower and delight everyone
Iterative process that requires you to examine your assumptions about how other people think and feel.

* Class
* culture
* ehthnicity
* language
* education
* political
* philosophical beliefs
* religion
* race
* gender
* sexual orientation
* age
* abilities
* disabilities
* handedness
* body measurements
* environment
* location
* connectivity
* modern tech

Abou tmakign people feel welcome and considered.

Today, we will discuss creating apps for games requires inclusivity to be infused into how you work.

# Common misconceptions

Inclusion is hard.  => Inclusion is a journey

Change is an iterative process and takes time.  Meaningful change requires planning, persistence, and patience.

Inclusive design limits creativity => stimulates new creative solutions

Make breakthroughs in experiences for everyone that woudln't happen if you didn't consider the diversity of human experience.  

Spend most of your energy creating new solutions in a narrow problem space.  

A diverse team means your app or game will be inclusive?  Having an *empowered* diverse eteam means your app or game *can* be enclusive.  

A person who is blind or has low vision, might have difficulty knowing when to move forward in a line independently.  Use LIDAR.

Inclusion can be done at the very end => Inclusion must be considered upfront.  Waiting until the end is reactionary, there isn't enough time to correct.

Build on these reframings to empower us to create more insluvie apps/games.  Take a deeper look into how you work.  Achieve your inclusion goals if you look at teams and environments.

# Teams/environments
* Reflect the world we serve
* See difference as an asset
* Commit to diversity early
* "Culture add" not "culture fit"

Want to make sure you are actively creating space and asking for perspectives in a judgment-free way.

**Time and space to think inclusively.**

Incorporate diverse perspectives.

Ideate => Design => Develop => Test => Release

Inclusion cannot be treated as an afterthought, since you don't want to release and discover it doesn't work well.  Taking time out of each phase to reflecton what you're making.

New, more insluvie task will ultimately make your app or game relate to more people.  Tackle things that may be complex or require longer time to thaw.

# Ideate
Why are you making this?
Who are you making it for?
Challenge your assumptions and listen

# Design
* Think about the extremes
* Emotional, social, and physical impact
* Location and context
	* Culture, environment, location, connectivity, etc.

# Develop
* Inclusive representation or expertise
* Plan for accessibility and localization
	* 15% of the world's population live with disabilities

# VoiceOver demo
#accessibility 
Image descriptions may accompany photos.  Great and inclusive photos experiences.

Use the description feature of markup to write your own descriptions of photos.

But many photos do not have descriptions.  ML can help.  Detailed, natural-language descriptions of images across iOS.  "Voiceover Recognition Image Description".

**Inclusion must be intentional.**  If you're workign on ML features, learn how different groups of people are represented.

Keep diversity axes in mind while thinking about what group to prioritize.  

# Intersectionality
Recognizes the unique experiences and needs of people who have multiple identities which are systematically disadvantaged.

We developed VoiceOver Recognition Image Description to be general-neutral.  A human-written description could include gender.

# Takeaways
* Inclusion is innovation for wider audiences
* Work at intersections of diversity axies
* Reach out to experts

# Test
* Diverse group using features
* Test with Assistive Technologies
* Listen, review, and prioritize feedback

# Release
* Make hard calls
* why can't it work for everyone?  If not now, when?
* Reevaluate and grow

# Inclusive iteration
Photo memories.  In iOS 15, we wanted to extent photo memory experience to be even more inclusive.  

> I take a lot of photos at my daughter's karate practice.  It'd be great to have them turn into a memory.

*Celebrate diversity* by celebrating themes that match who they are.

Brainstorming across the company.  Contents of our photo library is unique to each of us.  Consider multipel smaller groups.

Expanded our international holiday catalog.  Christmas, diwali, etc.  

> I don't like when the Photos app reminds me of my ex-partner

*Inclusion by designing with sensitivity.*

Specific topics require individual interviews for extra sensitivity.  For memories, we hosted several conversations.  Several people shared that they'd rather not be reminded of a person.

~~What makes a memory enjoyable or not?~~
**What are some of your favorite Memories?  What memories did you dislike?  What were you feeling after seeing it?  How can we make the experience better?**

Favor open-ended questions, refer to specific moments, and avoid using language that can influence their response.

It can be difficult to unexpectedly see photos of a loved one who passed away and be reminded of their absence.

"Feature Less" function.  

Validate solutions.  To make sure you are on the right track, important to circle back to the people you interviewed and seek their feedback.  Try to understand nuances you missed the first time.  

Leave it up to each person to decide between "feature less" and "never feature".  when we get too close to our projects we lose the broad view.

We avoided using thumbsdown because if a loved one passed away, you don't dislike them.  

By having inclusion in mind, you continue to make your experience better for everyone.

* Seek reviews and feedback
* Empathize and address
* Share back solutions for validation

# Inclusion is
* A journey
* Creative stimulation
* Narrow our scope and design with more intention
* Empowered diverse teams
* Infused into the entire process
